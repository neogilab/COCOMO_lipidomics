# COCOMO_lipidomics

A collection of R and Jupyter Notebook scripts created throughout my Master Thesis project "Associations between Clinical data and Omics datain in HIV Infected with and without Metabolic Syndrome".

The R scripts are contain lipidomics data analysis and the Jupyter Notebook script is a network analysis of the integration of lipidomics and metabolomics data. Data is based on HIV-infected from the Copenhagen Comorbidity in HIV-infection (COCOMO) study.
